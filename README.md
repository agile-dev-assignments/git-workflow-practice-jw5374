# [Retro Game Mechanics Explained](https://www.youtube.com/c/RetroGameMechanicsExplained/videos)
Not about Software Development directly, but it's interesting to see the clever ways in which retro game developer found solutions to certain problems. For example: their videos on Pokemon Sprite handling, starting with a "MissingNo." appearance explanation was enlightening as it (along with the follow up videos talking about how they decompress Pokemon sprites with the limited amount of space they had to work with) nicely shows how Pokemon sprites are normally displayed, and how this works to give "MissingNo." its exact glitchy appearance (from a bug that causes the game to read data from non-sprite related fields).

Alexander Bobb's comment: I read and enjoyed Joseph's paragraph and I found the Youtube channel very interesting. I am personally a visual learner so I think that finding a good and informative Youtube channel could be very useful.
